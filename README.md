# colabdario

This is a Maven Project running in a GlassFish server.

1) Clonning the project:
Go to the desired directory and then:
git clone https://github.com/felipepo/colabdario

2) DataBase:
This project possibly will use a Postgre database, but at the moment it's not required to have Postgre installed
on your system.

3) After that the easiest way to build the project is importing the project directory to NetBeans and running it.
Make sure that you have GlassFish installed and integrated on NetBeans.
